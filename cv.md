and my love for scientific and technical progress at the same time. 

**Strengths:**
* Thirst for knowledge
* Quick leaner
* Sense of purpose
* Responsibility

# **My Skills**

# **Code Examples**

while n >= 10:
    last = n % 10
    prelast = n % 100 // 10
    if last > prelast:
        flag = False
    n = n // 10
if flag:
    print('YES')
